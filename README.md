Below is a **template for documentation** tailored to the **LMS (Learning Management System)** repository at [Snossy123/LMS](https://github.com/Snossy123/LMS). Since I cannot directly access private repositories or external content, this template assumes a typical LMS structure based on common features (e.g., course management, student enrollment, reporting). Adjust the details to match your actual project.
